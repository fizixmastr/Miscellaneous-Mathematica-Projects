Collection of projects where I have used Wolfram's Mathematica. Mathematica was the primary language utilized by the Physics Department during my udergraduate work at Austin College where I graduated with a BA focused on Physics with a minor in Education. Lab 0 represents the formal training I had. All items shared here are mostly for posterity, with hope that I may revisit them later, and in most cases the original intent was simply for simple data manipulation.
